				<h1>About Shirley's Bakery</h1>
        <span>Meet Shirley</span>
				<p>Shirley's Bakery, the product of 70 plus years of baking, was renamed on Dec. 2, 1987 when Shirley Wernimont bought a bakery business in Jackson.

Raised in Medina, Shirley and her mother answered an ad for Sherry's Dandy Bakery in Milan a few weeks after she graduated from high school in 1973. She must have liked her first job, because she's been baking cakes, cookies and candies ever since.

Shirley brings a lifetime of experience and carries on the tradition begun by the Roe family during the World War II era. Before purchasing her own business, Shirley worked at Big John's and later Sunflower's in-store bakeries.</p>
				<span>The Beginning of a Legacy</span>
				<p>It all got started when Mr. and Mrs. Murry Roe founded a bakery inside the Simpson Center Super Store in the 1940s. Harold Simpson sold the grocery store to Winton Smith in 1963 and he renamed his business Highland Park Food Center and opened a bakery.</p>
        <p>The Roes then opened Roes' Petit Bakery on Forest Avenue and many tell the story of how Mrs. Roe would pass out fresh donuts to the neighborhood children as they walked by on their way to school.</p>
				<span>Change of Location</span>
				<p>Then a year after the Hamilton Hills Shopping Center was opened in 1970, the Roes decided to relocate their bakery and remained there until his death and her retirement. Their son, Merle, ran the business for a while and sold it to Lisa Caldwell who renamed it Northside Petit Bakery.</p>
				<span>The Legacy Continues</span>
				<p>For the third year in a row Shirley's Bakery was named "Best Bakery in West TN 2015" by the Tennessee Magazine. Shirley obviously loves what she does and many of her customers have become friends. She has shipped goodies from her bakery from coast to coast, and to soldiers fighting in the Middle East who wished for a taste of home.

Some customers regularly stop when they travel through Jackson to pick up their favorites from Shirley's. She smiles and laughs that it's a journey and she can't imagine doing anything else even though she never planned to spend her life baking sweets.</p>
