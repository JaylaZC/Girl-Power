Shirley's Bakery README
************************

Hello, this project was created by Jayla Cole and Kyra Jones. The business that we chose to do a website for is Shirley's Bakery that
is located in Jackson, TN. We chose to build a website for Mrs. Shirley because she did not have a website for the bakery. Therefore, we
worked together to create a website that would be useful for customers and Mrs. Shirley. 


Whole Website:

-Before we started to make the website, we looked at other bakery websites to see how their's was arranged and also to see what information
 they included in it that would be useful to the clients.
-All of the information on the site came from Mrs. Shirley and an article about her in the Jackson Sun.
-We chose to make to make our website simple yet professional, but still visually attractive to audiences of all ages.
-Our entire site is responsive to all phones, tablets, and computers.
-Our logo was originally made by us. Since the website is for a bakery, we decided to incorporate the baking theme inside the logo, which
 included a woman mixing cake batter in a bowl. 
-We chose to do a cupcake for the favicon since we didn't use it for the logo.
-We chose a color scheme that was centered around the color pink but, we used multiple shades of pink on every page of the website. We
 kept the background white because it allows the customers to be able to focus on the important information on the pages. 
-The footer includes links to their Facebook, Yelp, Wedding Wire, and Punchbowl accounts. It also includes extra information about the
 bakery and navagation tabs.


Home: 

-We made sure that our home page was very attractive so that it would make customers want to see more of the website.
-Our Home Page included a welcome message, a introduction into the food, pictures of the cakes, and a picture of some of the customers.


About:

-Our About Page contains information about Mrs. Shirley and the past owners of the bakery. It also includes a picture of Mrs.SHirley and a picture of the bakery.

Gallery:

-The gallery page includes over 100 pictures of cookies, cakes, and other sweet treats.
-All of the pictures came from Shirley's Bakery's Facebook Page.

Contact:

-The contact form allows customers to send Mrs.Shirley comments and questions that they may have.
-The form will be sent to Mrs.Shirley's email, but for testing purposes the form sends to my email.
